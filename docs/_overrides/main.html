{#
The entry point for the MkDocs Theme.
 
Any theme customisations should override this file to redefine blocks defined in
the various templates. The custom theme should only need to define a main.html
which `{% extends "base.html" %}` and defines various blocks which will replace
the blocks defined in base.html and its included child templates.

# Examples

Here you can find a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use **torchmil** in practice.

- [**Representing data in torchmil:**](data_representation.ipynb) we explain how data is represented in **torchmil**. We cover bags, instances, graphs, mini-batching, and more.
- [**Datasets in torchmil:**](datasets.ipynb) we explain how datasets are implemented in **torchmil**. We cover processed datasets vs non-processed datasets, and how to create your own dataset.
- [**Training your first MIL model:**](training_your_first_mil_model.ipynb) we show how to train a simple attention-based MIL model with a toy dataset.
- [**WSI classification in torchmil:**](wsi_classification.ipynb) we show how to train an attention-based MIL model with WSI data.
- [**CT scan classification in torchmil:**](ctscan_classification.ipynb) we show how to train a transformer-based MIL model with CT scan data.
